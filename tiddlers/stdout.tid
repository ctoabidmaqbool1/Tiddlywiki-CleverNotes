title: stdout

Stdout, also known as standard output, is the default file descriptor where a process/commandline-applications can write output.

In Unix-like operating systems, such as Linux, macOS X, and BSD, stdout is defined by the POSIX standard. Its default file descriptor number is 1.

In the terminal, standard output defaults to the user's screen.
