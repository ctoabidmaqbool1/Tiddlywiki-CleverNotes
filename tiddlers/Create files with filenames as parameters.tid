title: Create files with filenames as parameters

Here we are modifying [[Creating text files in a directory]] to pass filenames as parameters to script

<$macrocall $name="scr"
sn=createfileswithparams
sc='touch ~/$1 ~/$2'
bn="Create files with names as given in widget params"
bc= '$param="hey.txt haai.txt"'
/>


* Check your home folder for files named in widget params
